# image-classifier

This project is an Image Classification system built using PyTorch. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into predefined categories. The workflow includes data loading with torchvision, dataset preprocessing, augmentation, model building, training, validation, and performance tracking using accuracy and loss metrics.

Key Features:

Implemented using PyTorch and torchvision

Custom Dataset and DataLoader for efficient batching

CNN / Transfer Learning models (ResNet, VGG, etc.)

Data augmentation (transformations) for better generalization

Training loop with backpropagation + optimizer + scheduler

Visualizations for accuracy and loss

Model saving & inference script for predictions
